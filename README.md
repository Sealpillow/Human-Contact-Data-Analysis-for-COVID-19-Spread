# Human Contact Data Analysis for COVID-19 Spread  

**A Network-Based Epidemiological Analysis Using a Modified SPAIR Model**  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository presents a computational framework to identify **hidden spreaders**â€”asymptomatic, or highly connected individuals driving COVID-19 transmissionâ€”by analyzing human contact networks. 
Building on [previous research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32542-3), the study utilizes a modified SPAIR model (Susceptible, Presymptomatic, Asymptomatic, Infectious, Recovered) along with synthetic contact networks to simulate disease dynamics across various scenarios, including:
- **Network types**: Static (fixed connections), Dynamic (daily-changing interactions), Age-structured (demographic clustering).  
- **Interventions**: Vaccination, isolation, and demographic targeting.  
- **Key parameters**: Age distribution, vaccination rate, isolation timing, and population size.  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features  
1. **SPAIR Model Enhancements**  
   - Probabilistic state transitions (vs. duration-based transitions in traditional models).  
   - Integration of age-specific contact matrices and vaccination/isolation effects.
   - Explicit Consideration of Hidden Spreaders: Predicts the role of presymptomatic (P) and asymptomatic (A) individuals in transmission dynamics.
2. **Synthetic Network Generation**  
   - Configurable networks based on real-world demographic data (e.g., [Mossong et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050074)).  
   - Supports static, dynamic, and fully connected networks.  
3. **Intervention Analysis**  
   - Evaluates how timing (early vs. delayed) and coverage (1â€“10% daily vaccination) impact outbreak trajectories.

## ðŸ§¬ Model Dynamics  
### Key Equations & Parameters  
To identify hidden spreaders, we introduce a **network-based probabilistic approach** that models transitions between infectious states using **transition probabilities** and **network topology**.  

- A **Markovian process** governs state transitions in the **SPAIR model** (Susceptible, Presymptomatic, Asymptomatic, Infectious, Recovered).  
- Each node (individual) has a probability of **changing states** based on infection likelihood, recovery rates, and external interventions (e.g., vaccination, isolation).  
- Using known infected individuals, we estimate **hidden spreaders** by analyzing **indirect transmission pathways** in the network.  

| Parameter       | Description                          | Value/Range      |  
|:---------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------:|  
|$R_0$| Basic reproduction number           | 3.5 (baseline)   |  
| $p$          | Asymptomatic fraction               | 15%              |  
| Vaccination rate| Daily immunization coverage         | 1â€“10% of population |  
| Intervention day| Start day for vaccination/isolation | 15â€“30 (post-outbreak)|  

#### **1. Transition Supporting Formula**  
$P_i(t)$ - Probability that an individual is in Presymtomatic state </br>
$I_i(t)$ - Probability that an individual is in Infectious state  </br>
$A_i(t)$ - Probability that an individual is in Asymtomatic state </br>

| Description | Formula |
|:------------:|:-------------:|
| Infected Probability | $C_i(t) = P_i(t) + I_i(t) + A_i(t)$ |
| Infection Probability To A Single Neighbou | $F(t, j, \beta) = C_j(t) \cdot \beta$ |
| Probability Of Not Infected By All Neighbour | $\prod\limits_{j \in \partial_i} \left( 1 - F(t, j, \beta) \right)$ |
| Probability Of Infected By Any Neighbour | $1 - \prod\limits_{j \in \partial_i} \left( 1 - F(t, j, \beta) \right)$ |
| Transmission probability | $\beta = \frac{R_0}{\lambda(k)}$ |
| Average time a susceptible person carries the virus | $\lambda = p \cdot \mu_A + (1 - p) \cdot \left( \exp\left( \mu_p + \frac{\sigma_p^2}{2} \right) + \mu_I \right)$ |


#### **2. Transition Probabilities**  
Each infected individual progresses through different states with assigned probabilities:  

| Transition | Description | Probability |
|:------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| S â†’ P | Susceptible to Presymptomatic | $P_i(t+1) = S_i(t) \cdot (1 - p) \cdot \left( 1 - \prod\limits_{j \in \partial_i} \left( 1 - F(t, j, \beta) \right) \right)$ |
| S â†’ A | Susceptible to Asymptomatic | $A_i(t+1) = S_i(t) \cdot p \cdot \left( 1 - \prod\limits_{j \in \partial_i} \left( 1 - F(t, j, \beta) \right) \right)$ |
| S â†’ S | Remain Susceptible | $S_i(t+1) = 1 - P_i(t+1)- A_i(t+1)$ |
| P â†’ I | Presymptomatic to Infectious | $I_i(t+1) = \sum\limits_{d=1}^{\infty} P_i \cdot \left( \frac{F_P(d) - F_P(d-1)}{1 - F_P(d-1)} \right)$ |
| P â†’ P | Remain Presymptomatic | $P_i(t+1) = 1 - I_i(t+1)$ |
| I â†’ R | Infectious to Recovered | $R_i(t+1) = R_i(t) + \sum\limits_{d=1}^{\infty} I_i \cdot \left( \frac{F_I(d) - F_I(d-1)}{1 - F_I(d-1)} \right)$ |
| I â†’ I | Remain Infectious | $I_i(t+1) = 1 - R_i(t+1)$ |
| A â†’ R | Infectious to Recovered | $R_i(t+1) = R_i(t) + \sum\limits_{d=1}^{\infty} A_i \cdot \left( \frac{F_A(d) - F_A(d-1)}{1 - F_A(d-1)} \right)$ |
| A â†’ A | Remain Infectious | $A_i(t+1) = 1 - R_i(t+1)$ |

where:  
- k is the average number of neighbors in the contact tracing network
- Î» is the average time a susceptible person carries the virus
- FP(d), FI(d), and FA(d) are the cumulative distribution functions of the duration length d for the respective states.
- $âˆ‚_i$ represents the set of neighbors of i in the network, and F(t,j,Î²) is the probability that i is infected by j on day t.
- $\mu_A$, $\exp\left(\mu_p + \frac{\sigma_p^2}{2}\right)$, $\mu_I$ are the average time of the virus carried by infected individuals in A, P, and I states respectively.


#### **3. Vaccination Impact**  
Vaccination modifies an individualâ€™s susceptibility and reduces overall network transmission:  
$R_0 = R_0 \ (1 - \text{Vaccination Effectiveness})$

#### **4. Isolation Effects**  
Isolation removes individuals in infectious state from the network, reducing effective transmission:  

#### **5. Age-Based Connection Network**  
Individual Connections are generated based age group connections </br>

when Age Factor is not considered, connection is assigned using normal distribution of the largest standard deviation/mean Age Group (10-14)

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings  
1. **Network Structure Matters**  
   - **Static networks**: Early peak (Day 25), rapid decline.  
   - **Dynamic networks**: Prolonged transmission with shifting spreaders.  
   - **Age-structured networks**: Localized outbreaks in high-connectivity cohorts (e.g., young adults).  
2. **Intervention Timing**  
   - Early vaccination (Day 15) reduces infections by **31%** vs. no intervention.  
   - Isolation post-peak (Day 25) still truncates outbreak duration by 22%.  
3. **Demographic Targeting**  
   - Prioritizing high-connectivity groups (e.g., age 25â€“44) disrupts superspreading hubs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Implications for Public Health  
- **Actionable Strategies**:  
  - Combine age-targeted vaccination with workplace/school isolation protocols.  
  - Deploy adaptive surveillance for dynamic networks (e.g., real-time contact tracing).  
- **Policy Design**:  
  - Balance urgency (early interventions) and precision (demographic focus) to protect vulnerable populations.
