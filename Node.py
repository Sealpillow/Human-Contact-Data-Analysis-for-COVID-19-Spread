class Node:
    """
    A class to represent a node in a network, storing its properties, connections, 
    and probabilities related to health states in a disease simulation.

    Methods:
        __init__(id, day, age):
            Initializes a node with its ID, day, age, health status probabilities, 
            and an empty list of connections.

        addConnection(connection):
            Adds a new connection to the node's list of connections.

        getConnection(nodeTo):
            Retrieves a specific connection by the connected node's identifier.

        getConnections():
            Returns the list of all connections associated with the node.

        removeConnection(currentNetworkNodes):
            Removes all connections associated with the node, ensuring that reciprocal 
            connections in other nodes are also removed from the network.

    Attributes:
        id (str): Unique identifier for the node.
        connections (list): List of connected nodes (edges).
        status (str): Current state of the person (e.g., Susceptible, Infectious).
        S (float): Probability of remaining Susceptible the next day.
        P (float): Probability of transitioning to the Presymptomatic state.
        A (float): Probability of transitioning to the Asymptomatic state.
        I (float): Probability of transitioning to the Infectious state.
        R (float): Probability of transitioning to the Recovered state.
        C (float): Total probability of being in the Infectious state.
        age (int): Age of the individual represented by the node.
        day (int): Day of simulation when the node was created.
        avgConnectionByAge (int): Average Connection determined by age group.
        vaccinated (bool): Vaccination status of the person
